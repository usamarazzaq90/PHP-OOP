# PHP OOP Assignment â€“ User Class with Inheritance and Interfaces

This project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in PHP** by creating a simple user management system using **inheritance, interfaces, and abstraction**.

The goal is to:
- Practice **class inheritance** (base `User` class extended by `AdminUser` and `CustomerUser`).
- Implement **interfaces** (`Authenticatable`) to enforce common methods (`login` and `logout`).
- Demonstrate **real-world use cases** like admin user management and customer purchases.
